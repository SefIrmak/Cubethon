My very first attempt of tutorial of Brackeys!


Starting with Menu when click Start system starts the game

Game has 3 level and each level has its difficulty is raised!

If player crashes to obstacles game will restart its level after 1 second

After dodging obstacles at the end of the level system prompts a level finished window
